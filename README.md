# Roman Numeral Generator demo
Two approaches are provided, `romans1.js` and `romans2.js`. Read the source to see the differences; I find the former more elegant, though the latter is significantly more performant. Run `npm run benchmark` or `npm run benchmark 3999` (or any other int between 1 and 3999 inclusive) to see the difference.
